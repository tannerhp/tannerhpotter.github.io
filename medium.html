        <header> May 24, 2022: the curse of social media influencing </header>
            <p> Sarah can quote me on this being a long-held belief: being a social media influencer is a curse. I don't wish it upon my enemies. The more proximate one is to influencing based on their appearance, the worst.
            Apparently, a cousin of mine is getting divorced. I know about it because the world of TikTok, Reddit, group message, and so forth are all over it. And maybe not. Sarah just told me it might not be true. A waste, most of it.</p>
        
        <header> May 25, 2022: ups and downs of startup life  </header>
        <p> Perhaps similar in mechanic to the stickiness of wages, communal perceptions of startup value are also sticky -- it's hard to believe said company won't be the darling unicorn that it is today. After a few years in the industry, I'm beginning to feel
            just how many ups and downs exist for each company. Imagine how the founder feels. Especially when much of that value is out of your control.
          This year, the supply chain of capital began valuing companies on 3x revenue multiples rather than 30x revenue multiples of yesteryear. This has a drastic impact on every capital owner in the supply chain. </p>
        
        <header> May 26, 2022: hotels  </header>
        <p> My relationship to hotels has really changed over the years. Once the paragon of rest, vacations, and endless ESPN, now shadowy, unrestful room with no memory foam pillows. The random sounds and lights. The faux cleanliness.  </p>
        
        <header> May 27, 2022: dense </header>
        <p> Boston is a dense city. It's thick with characte and culture. High-minded yet hard. American-loving yet liberal. Each borough (impossible to track each) is seemingly distinct. I'm in Chelsea, an area known for its high number of immigrants.
            Cambridge for its students. Newton its academics. Belmont its families. And so on. What a beautiful city of red brick, rife with harbors and inlets, and proximate quaint New England towns. There is no shortage of great sports or food. The Irish Catholic
            Uber driver could care less what school you went to. </p>
