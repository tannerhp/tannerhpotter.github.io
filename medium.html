        <header> May 24, 2022: the curse of social media influencing </header>
            <p> Sarah can quote me on this being a long-held belief: being a social media influencer is a curse. I don't wish it upon my enemies. The more proximate one is to influencing based on their appearance, the worst.
            Apparently, a cousin of mine is getting divorced. I know about it because the world of TikTok, Reddit, group message, and so forth are all over it. And maybe not. Sarah just told me it might not be true. A waste, most of it.</p>
        
        <header> May 25, 2022: ups and downs of startup life  </header>
        <p> Perhaps similar in mechanic to the stickiness of wages, communal perceptions of startup value are also sticky -- it's hard to believe said company won't be the darling unicorn that it is today. After a few years in the industry, I'm beginning to feel
            just how many ups and downs exist for each company. Imagine how the founder feels. Especially when much of that value is out of your control.
          This year, the supply chain of capital began valuing companies on 3x revenue multiples rather than 30x revenue multiples of yesteryear. This has a drastic impact on every capital owner in the supply chain. </p>
        
        <header> May 26, 2022: hotels  </header>
        <p> My relationship to hotels has really changed over the years. Once the paragon of rest, vacations, and endless ESPN, now shadowy, unrestful room with no memory foam pillows. The random sounds and lights. The faux cleanliness.  </p>
        
        <header> May 27, 2022: dense </header>
        <p> Boston is a dense city. It's thick with character and culture. High-minded yet hard. American-loving yet liberal. Each borough (impossible to track each) is seemingly distinct. I'm in Chelsea, an area known for its high number of immigrants.
            Cambridge for its students. Newton its academics. Belmont its families. And so on. What a beautiful city of red brick, rife with harbors and inlets, and proximate quaint New England towns. There is no shortage of great sports or food. The Irish Catholic
            Uber driver could care less what school you went to. </p>
        
        <header> June 1, 2022: warnings </header>
        <p> Warnings, without lived experience, carry so much less weight. I'm now about at my 2 year mark as a venture capitalist. What an odd journey -- joinning just post-Covid when the tech world was supposed to fall apart, only to see a strange
            technology effervesence, resulting in a great harvest. But it's 2022. And now I'm up late figuring out the financial, legal, and personel decisions behind a re-capitalization. Recaps hit different when its a company you recommended. Only then, are the lessons
            of overpricing a round, of burning too hot, of dilution, of a weak Series A market really settling upon my soul. Raising at too high of a valuation causes serious problems. A VC_backed startup is a momentum journey. Take too much of that momentum in round 2, and you find
            your business faceplanting. Heed the warnings.
            
            I've been reading Talent by Tyler Cowen and Daniel Gross. It's an excellent read. VCs are part- talent scout, part - therapist, and part - gambler. One of the most honorable values provided by VCs is when we help to raise ambitions, prodding individuals to take 
            risks that change the world, but mostly by creating contagious ambition and mimetic desire with those in their company and circles. </p>
        
        <header> June 2, 2022: taste </header>
        <p> How do you know when someone has taste in a particular area? a website, fashion style, home decor, music choice. I don't have enough taste, but longer I live the more I think it matters. This is an ongoing question for me. </p>
        
        <header> June 5, 2022: ambition </header>
        <p> How do you raise your personal ambitions? Lately, I've tried reminding myself. One way may be to fiddle with the inputs of ambition -- i.e., vision, intelligence, connections, open-mindedness, energy. From the outside looking in,
            it seems endless reservoirs of energy are requisite for ambition to flourish. A uniquely helpful dimension of business school at Harvard was the ability to *feel* and *experience* the pace at which a somewhat diverse set of individuals
            go. And let me tell you -- most MBAers are the go-go-go type. Another helpful element in raising ambition at business school is hearing firsthand from business owners, tech founders, private equity overlords, etc. There is something about being
            in the same room, feeling the conductivity of another human nearby that reminds you--yep, they're human, too. Some are standard deviations above the norm in smarts. Most, I'd venture, have high multiplicative intelligence across dimensions but nothing
            fancy in one area. Go big or go home.
            
        <header> June 5, 2022: VC status games </header>
        <p> Out of undergrad I chose between 4 companies: Amazon, Goldman Sachs, Cornerstone Research, and Vivint. I chose Vivint. The thrust of the decision was driven by a spiritual side - I felt I should go there. I didn't want to want to go there. Staying in 
            Utah, working at that door-to-door sales company while my peers went to Bain, McKinsey, or Google, was not appealing. "Where do you work?", "Vivint", "The sales company?", "Well, I'm on the product side", "oh, cool."
            That got old. Now I work in the high status world of venture capital. Where most people want your product, a few really need it, and a few don't want it but you really need them to buy it. By virtue of the money I represent,
            I have power in the community. People want to talk to me; perhaps a tiny bit of that is also that as a VC you are unique in a see of startup operators. Interestingly, the power dynamic can switch very quickly if a VC is interested & 
            there are competitive dynamics at play. Perhaps even more interesting for me is the fact that as a VC, your main public job is to *listen*. Mostly, you aren't the star of the show. The founder(s) is. Even after 20 years in the business,
            someone else is talking, and you listen, peppering the pitcher with a few questions. So, status in VC is inherent but capricous. And it's status that brings you to the room; you aren't the center of attention, CEO Bob is... as it should be.
