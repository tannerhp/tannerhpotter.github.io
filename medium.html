        <header> May 24, 2022: the curse of social media influencing </header>
            <p> Sarah can quote me on this being a long-held belief: being a social media influencer is a curse. I don't wish it upon my enemies. The more proximate one is to influencing based on their appearance, the worst.
            Apparently, a cousin of mine is getting divorced. I know about it because the world of TikTok, Reddit, group message, and so forth are all over it. And maybe not. Sarah just told me it might not be true. A waste, most of it.</p>
        
        <header> May 25, 2022: ups and downs of startup life  </header>
        <p> Perhaps similar in mechanic to the stickiness of wages, communal perceptions of startup value are also sticky -- it's hard to believe said company won't be the darling unicorn that it is today. After a few years in the industry, I'm beginning to feel
            just how many ups and downs exist for each company. Imagine how the founder feels. Especially when much of that value is out of your control.
          This year, the supply chain of capital began valuing companies on 3x revenue multiples rather than 30x revenue multiples of yesteryear. This has a drastic impact on every capital owner in the supply chain. </p>
        
        <header> May 26, 2022: hotels  </header>
        <p> My relationship to hotels has really changed over the years. Once the paragon of rest, vacations, and endless ESPN, now shadowy, unrestful room with no memory foam pillows. The random sounds and lights. The faux cleanliness.  </p>
        
        <header> May 27, 2022: dense </header>
        <p> Boston is a dense city. It's thick with character and culture. High-minded yet hard. American-loving yet liberal. Each borough (impossible to track each) is seemingly distinct. I'm in Chelsea, an area known for its high number of immigrants.
            Cambridge for its students. Newton its academics. Belmont its families. And so on. What a beautiful city of red brick, rife with harbors and inlets, and proximate quaint New England towns. There is no shortage of great sports or food. The Irish Catholic
            Uber driver could care less what school you went to. </p>
        
        <header> June 1, 2022: warnings </header>
        <p> Warnings, without lived experience, carry so much less weight. I'm now about at my 2 year mark as a venture capitalist. What an odd journey -- joinning just post-Covid when the tech world was supposed to fall apart, only to see a strange
            technology effervesence, resulting in a great harvest. But it's 2022. And now I'm up late figuring out the financial, legal, and personel decisions behind a re-capitalization. Recaps hit different when its a company you recommended. Only then, are the lessons
            of overpricing a round, of burning too hot, of dilution, of a weak Series A market really settling upon my soul. Raising at too high of a valuation causes serious problems. A VC_backed startup is a momentum journey. Take too much of that momentum in round 2, and you find
            your business faceplanting. Heed the warnings.
            
            I've been reading Talent by Tyler Cowen and Daniel Gross. It's an excellent read. VCs are part- talent scout, part - therapist, and part - gambler. One of the most honorable values provided by VCs is when we help to raise ambitions, prodding individuals to take 
            risks that change the world, but mostly by creating contagious ambition and mimetic desire with those in their company and circles. </p>
        
        <header> June 2, 2022: taste </header>
        <p> How do you know when someone has taste in a particular area? a website, fashion style, home decor, music choice. I don't have enough taste, but longer I live the more I think it matters. This is an ongoing question for me. </p>
        
        <header> June 5, 2022: ambition </header>
        <p> How do you raise your personal ambitions? Lately, I've tried reminding myself. One way may be to fiddle with the inputs of ambition -- i.e., vision, intelligence, connections, open-mindedness, energy. From the outside looking in,
            it seems endless reservoirs of energy are requisite for ambition to flourish. A uniquely helpful dimension of business school at Harvard was the ability to *feel* and *experience* the pace at which a somewhat diverse set of individuals
            go. And let me tell you -- most MBAers are the go-go-go type. Another helpful element in raising ambition at business school is hearing firsthand from business owners, tech founders, private equity overlords, etc. There is something about being
            in the same room, feeling the conductivity of another human nearby that reminds you--yep, they're human, too. Some are standard deviations above the norm in smarts. Most, I'd venture, have high multiplicative intelligence across dimensions but nothing
            fancy in one area. Go big or go home.
            
        <header> June 5, 2022: VC status games </header>
        <p> Out of undergrad I chose between 4 companies: Amazon, Goldman Sachs, Cornerstone Research, and Vivint. I chose Vivint. The thrust of the decision was driven by a spiritual side - I felt I should go there. I didn't want to want to go there. Staying in 
            Utah, working at that door-to-door sales company while my peers went to Bain, McKinsey, or Google, was not appealing. "Where do you work?", "Vivint", "The sales company?", "Well, I'm on the product side", "oh, cool."
            That got old. Now I work in the high status world of venture capital. Where most people want your product, a few really need it, and a few don't want it but you really need them to buy it. By virtue of the money I represent,
            I have power in the community. People want to talk to me; perhaps a tiny bit of that is also that as a VC you are unique in a see of startup operators. Interestingly, the power dynamic can switch very quickly if a VC is interested & 
            there are competitive dynamics at play. Perhaps even more interesting for me is the fact that as a VC, your main public job is to *listen*. Mostly, you aren't the star of the show. The founder(s) is. Even after 20 years in the business,
            someone else is talking, and you listen, peppering the pitcher with a few questions. So, status in VC is inherent but capricous. And it's status that brings you to the room; you aren't the center of attention, CEO Bob is... as it should be.
       
        <header> June 6, a nice pairing 2022 </header>
        <p> Pair "Revolt of the Public" with the Amazon series "The Boys". My serendipitous consumption of each reinforced the thesis that the information age broke the relationship between the elites and the people. When a revolt in Egypt that led to the overthrow
            of a 30-year dictatorship was coordinated on Facebook by an ordinary citizen with loose ties to fellow revolutionaries -- something is up. It's the kind of paradigm shift that is *felt*. The Boys plays on these themes perfectly, highlighting sinister feedback loops
            brought about by information -- superhero missteps, citizen records, social media hosts, superhero coversup, proles redden, elites hide, institutions rot. </p>
        
        <header> June 7, we aren't pairing well as Gods, 2022 </header>
        <p> "We are as Gods, so we might as well get good at it." - Stewart Brand (see: https://www.weareasgods.film/). I just so happened to pair the trailer of this documentary with an article on how the Great Salt Lake drying up could be a nuclear bomb. Another serendipitous
            pairing. The lake dries up, dust and particulates come out to play. When different chemicals produced by mining decide to come out of their shell, it's a bad thing. My beloved Farmington is right along the eastern coasat of the lake at the heart of the Great Basin. Lose
            the lake, lose a lot more than brine ship. It appears we aren't being good gods. I'm quite worried." </p>
        
        <header> June 8th, that word </header>
        <p> I'm not sure if it's more telling about me or about the word -- strategy -- that despite getting a degree in business strategy and an MBA at Harvard Business School, I just looked up the definition for strategy.
            According to an HBR article referencing Michael Porter, this will due for one characterization: "Do what everyone else is doing (but spend less money doing it), or do something no one else can do." 
            (https://hbr.org/2015/05/what-is-strategy-again#:~:text=Strategy%2C%20it%20follows%20for%20Porter,forces%20in%20your%20competitive%20environment.) Why are people so attracted to 'strategy'? Perhaps people love cogitating about how to win competitively, the dream of breakthroughs
            on a heavily diagrammed whiteboard. Perhaps, because of what it isn't perceived to be -- the daily grind of execution. The evil eye peering in on someone in Strategy sees one who gets to think about CEO-level problems, without CEO-level responsibilty.
        
        <header> June 9th, economic growth as a moral </header>
        <p> "The Truth is rarely pure and never simple". - Oscar Wilde ... can one say this quote is true? Or is that too simple? </p>
        <p> I'm reading too many books right now simultaneously. One of those is Stubborn Attachments by Tyler Cowen. Aside: Stripe Press is bringing sexy back with their books. I love the covers, the typography, colors on the pages. What a delightful experience -- why is a payments company my favorite publisher?
            Tyler argues that focusing on economic prosperity as a *moral*. Previoulsy, I had aligned with the idea of econonmic growth, but hadn't extended the idea so far as an ethic of mine. I think Tyler has converted me to this -- with his same caveat, that human rights
            need also be protected. One of my friends in Kenya was mugged. The muggers were attempting to steal his personal property. He righteously beat up the skebangas. After getting a picture of them and showing it to the police, they did nothing.
            An anecdote sure, but that is a highlight of the lack of prosperity on the accounts of the muggers and lack of institutional integrity often associated with low prosperity in the account of the police. I think we miss just how much better
            life is because of America's general economic prosperity, despite its attendent failings. Try the alternative. </p>
        
        <header> June 10th, 2022 </header>
        <p> The job of a VC is part talent scout, part inspector sleuth, part journalist, part therapist, part coach. No wonder I have impostor syndrome. </p>
        <p> I have a running theory based on a trend I'm seeing -- tech companies as a mini-government. Increasingly, companies are filling the role of job, social network, therapy, financial advisor, retirement specialist, political haven. As previous local, city, state, and federal instituions rot, employees expect
            business to fill the role. In addition to adding government-instituted 401k plans, where companies match savings rather than simply give employees that cash, I've seen pitches for companies to play a role in matching for a home savings acocunt, an emergency cash account, a travel account, a learning account,
            a financial advisory, a therapy budget, etc. Instead of giving the employee this cash, we are reducing salary to recieve incentives toward nudges that government and company think we want. Is this the way? </p>
        
        <header> June 11th, 2022: serenity & serendpitiy of saturday </header
        <p> There is such serenity in the dawn of calm Saturday. One where you can read on the porch as the sun warms your bones. Tyler Cowen's Stubborn Attachment has been a very insightful book for me.
            As he writes re: morals, the inherent unpredictability of consequences, and a footnote on probability theory, I'm thinking about its application to VC. As I see it, each investment opportunity has a dynamic (Bayesian) probability distribution.
            My job--then--is through diligence, to match my estimated probability with actual. Diligence can be problematic, especially at early stages, where data is yet-to-exist, resulting in a greater projected-to-actual distribution delta. Next, after matching distributions, ideally you negotiate to win the opportunity.
            Here, reflexivity is at play. Bryce Roberts, a fellow VC, tweeted that the goal of VC is "Improved odds". I agree -- ideally, for said investment opportunity, your invovlement in a company increases the odds more than other equity dollars do. Spurred thought number 2 -- Cowen writes about ideas begatting ideas. "Once an idea has been generated, it can be used many times by 
            many different people at very low marginal cost. The first idea spreads, begats subsequent ideas, and so growth increases." (Stubborn Attachments, pp 97) One aspect of being an investor I've appreciated is seeing micro-economics at play; certain ideas, whether a new business model, a successful go-to-market strategy,
            a new technology, seem to pop up in clusters. In my 2 years on the job, I've seen that with NFTs, marketplace business models, business benefit matching (see previous post), SAAS for sports tickets, others I don't recall at the moment. Entrepreneurs sniff out these ideas as profit opportunities.
