        <header> May 24, 2022: the curse of social media influencing </header>
            <p> Sarah can quote me on this being a long-held belief: being a social media influencer is a curse. I don't wish it upon my enemies. The more proximate one is to influencing based on their appearance, the worst.
            Apparently, a cousin of mine is getting divorced. I know about it because the world of TikTok, Reddit, group message, and so forth are all over it. And maybe not. Sarah just told me it might not be true. A waste, most of it.</p>

        <p> Perhaps similar to wages, it seems to me that perception of startup value is sticky -- hard to believe said company won't be the darling unicorn that it is today. After a few years in the industry, I'm beginning to see
            that this isn't the case. Slowly,and then all at once, the public markets changed their minds. The supply chain of capital began assessing companies of 3x revenue multiples. This has a drastic impact on every capital owner in the sucpply chain. </p>
